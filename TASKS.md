## Implementation Plan
1. The user can select their preferred language during initial bot startup or change it later
2. Language preference is stored in the User model and used throughout the application
3. Quiz questions are loaded from language-specific YAML files
4. All UI messages and buttons are translated according to the user's language preference
5. Reports are generated in the user's preferred language using language-specific OpenAI prompts

## Issues Fixed
1. Moved the German quiz file to the correct location (hospital_quiz_bot/data/quizes_de.yaml)
2. Fixed the path in QuizService to correctly locate the German quiz file
3. Updated cancel_button and main_menu_button handlers to pass session_pool parameter
4. Fixed untranslated UI elements:
   - Added language parameter to all keyboard generation functions
   - Updated all handlers to pass language preference to keyboards
   - Added German translations for all button labels
   - Added language-specific messages for errors and confirmations
   - Updated all handlers to recognize German button presses
5. Fixed report generation issues:
   - Added create_new method to QuizResponseRepository
   - Updated format_report_message to handle both string and dictionary inputs
   - Updated report handlers to use language-specific messages and buttons
6. Added German report generation support:
   - Added German prompt template to prompts.md
   - Updated OpenAIService to load and use German prompts
   - Updated ReportService to pass language parameter to OpenAI calls
   - Modified handlers to initialize ReportService with the correct language

## Running the Migration
To apply the database changes, run the migration script:
```bash
cd hospital_quiz_bot
python -m app.database.migrations.add_language_fields
```

## Testing Instructions
1. Start the bot using `python -m hospital_quiz_bot.bot`
2. Send `/start` to the bot and select a language
3. Start a quiz with `/quiz` and verify questions appear in the selected language
4. Try changing the language with the "üåê –ó–º—ñ–Ω–∏—Ç–∏ –º–æ–≤—É" or "üåê Sprache √§ndern" button
5. Verify that new quizzes use the updated language
6. Check that all buttons and messages appear in the correct language
7. Complete a quiz and verify that the report is displayed correctly in the selected language
8. Verify that reports are generated in the correct language with appropriate medical terminology
